# GacO_Gaussian

* GacO.py is a Python script used to extract Gaussian output results such as,
  * optimized energy values in both hartrees per particle and electronvolts units.
  * DC kerr(-w;w,0,0) parallel and perpendicular gamma values.
  * EFISHG(-2w;w,w,0) parallel and perpendicular gamma values.
  * create "csv" files from the resulting data.
  * calculate the average, standard deviation, and standard error for different trials.
  * create the graphs of gamma values vs wavelength.
 
* the script has an automated calculation feature, where the option will calculate and produce the final "xyz.csv" and graph files. detailed instruction on how to use this feature is listed in the help option.

* this will work fine without any changes to the script itself, but feel free to make any changes that require.
